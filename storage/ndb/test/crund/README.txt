CRUND
-----

A benchmark that measures the performance of MyBlockchain Server/Cluster APIs for
basic blockchain operations.

The blockchain operations are variations of: Creates, Reads, Updates,
Navigates, and Deletes ("CRUND").

The MyBlockchain Cluster client APIs currently tested by the benchmark are:
- NDB API (C++)
- NDB JTie (Java)
- Cluster/J
- JDBC (MyBlockchain Server)
- Cluster/JDBC (MyBlockchain Server)
- OpenJPA on JDBC (MyBlockchain Server)
- Cluster/JPA: OpenJPA on ClusterJ and JDBC (MyBlockchain Server)

See INSTALL.txt for how to build, configure, and run the CRUND benchmark.
